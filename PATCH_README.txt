Upload these files to the same paths in your repo (overwrite). This adds an ErrorBoundary, enables sourcemaps, and removes StrictMode so runtime errors won't white-screen and the console will show readable stacks.

Files:
- src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- src/App.tsx
- src/main.tsx
- vite.config.ts
